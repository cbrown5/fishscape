## Description

This is a database of fish associations with their habitats. We (primarily Andrew) reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey literatures for evidence of fish associations with particular habitats.

It is a long-form database, where each row corresponds to one observation of a fish habitat association. A single paper can have multiple rows if for instance it reports on multiple species, or it has measured fish-habitat relationships for a single species in multiple different ways.
"Fish" includes bony and cartilaginous fish and fished invertebrates.

Currently we have focussed on species included in the [RAM Legacy database](http://ramlegacy.org/). We plan to expand the database to all species in the FAO catch series in 2018.
